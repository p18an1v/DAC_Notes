reference


reference is just another name to a variable.
reference is not allocated any memory.
reference must be initialized.
once initialized it cannot refer to another referent.
reference gets dereferenced automatically ( in comparison with pointer which has be dereferenced explicitly using *)

e.g.

 int num = 10;
 int& ref = num;
 cout << num << endl;
 cout << ref << endl;




The compiler treats ref as an alias for num.

Every use of ref is replaced by num in generated machine code (after compilation).

In essence, ref doesn’t exist as a separate variable in memory.

		cout << ref << endl;


The compiler replaces ref with num internally.

So machine code reads from num’s memory location and prints 10.

There is no dereference operator needed; this is done automatically by the compiler.
