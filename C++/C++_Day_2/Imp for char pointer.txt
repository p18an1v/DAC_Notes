void disp(char* ptr)
{
	cout << *ptr << endl;
}
int main()
{
	disp("hello");  // error
}

	will not compile as "hello" is of type "pointer to const". In order to collect it , you have to have "pointer to const" as an argument. So the above code has to be written as


void disp(const char* ptr)
{
	cout << *ptr << endl;
}
int main()
{
	disp("hello");  
}

what if we don't want to give "pointer to constant" as a member in "disp"?

Following code will work :



void disp(char* ptr)
{
	cout << *ptr << endl;
}
int main()
{
	disp((char*)"hello");
}
