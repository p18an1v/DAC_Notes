int age;
char name[20];
cout << "Enter age" << endl;
cin >> age;        
cout << "Enter full name" << endl;
cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\n'); // cin.ignore(...) line clears the leftover newline before getline() runs
cin.getline(name, 19); 
cout << name << "\t" << age << endl;

[ in the above code “cin.ignore” is needed because cin >> (for numbers or words) stops reading just before the newline,
and that leftover newline messes up getline() (it reads it as an empty line). ]

int age;
char name[20];
cout << "Enter full name" << endl;
cin.getline(name, 19);
cout << "Enter age" << endl;
cin >> age;        
cout << name << "\t" << age << endl;

[ in the above code “cin.ignore” is not needed as getline() (for string or char array) reads the entire line, including spaces and importantly it consumes newline also. ]

int age;
char name[20];
cout << "Enter age" << endl;
cin >> age;     
cout << "Enter full name" << endl;
cin >> name;  // it will terminate at the space
cout << name << "\t" << age << endl;

[ in the above code “cin.ignore” is not needed because :

Step 1 — cin >> age
	User types:
	25    [ presses enter key ]
	cin >> age reads the number 25.
	It leaves the newline '\n' in the input buffer.

Step 2 — cin >> name
	cin >> (for strings or char arrays) automatically skips any whitespace at the beginning — including spaces, tabs, or newlines.
	So, when it starts reading name, it sees the leftover newline, skips it, and waits for the next word.
 That’s why it works fine — the leftover newline doesn’t cause a problem here. ]

int age;
char name[20],address[40];
cout << "Enter age" << endl;
cin >> age;     
cout << "Enter full name" << endl;
cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\n');
cin.getline(name, 19);
cout << "Enter address" << endl;
cin.getline(address, 39);
cout << name << "\t" << age <<"\t"<<address<< endl;


[ in the above code why don't we need cin.ignore after 
cin.getline(name, 19); 
cout << "Enter address" << endl; 

	these lines ?

it's because   cin.getline(name,19)  will read the characters entered by user and store them in "name" , also getline will remove '\n' from the input buffer. That means when we say cin.getline(address,39) , there is no \n  left inside the buffer and now getline will wait for you to enter the characters ]
