/*

cin >> age;
cin.getline(name, 19);

When we use cin >> age, the user types something like:

25 [ and presses enter key ]

Here’s what actually goes into the input buffer:

'2' '5' '\n'

The >> operator reads only the number 25.

But it leaves the newline character ('\n') in the input buffer.

Then cin.getline() sees that newline '\n' immediately and thinks:

"Oh, the user pressed Enter, so the line is empty."

So it reads an empty string ("") into name.

That’s why this program skips the name input.

    cin >> age;         // Suppose user types: 25 and presses enter
    cout << "Enter full name" << endl;
    cin.getline(name, 19); // This will immediately take the leftover '\n'
    cout << name << "\t" << age << endl;
}
