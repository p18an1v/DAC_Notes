In programming languages, particularly C++, linkage describes how names can or can not refer to the same variable name or function name throughout the whole program or one single translation unit (one cpp file).

Automatic (local) variables exist only temporarily, on the stack, while a function is being called. The linker doesn't know about automatic variables, and so these have "no linkage".

There are 4 types of linkages:

external linkage
internal linkage
typesafe linkage
alternate linkage
