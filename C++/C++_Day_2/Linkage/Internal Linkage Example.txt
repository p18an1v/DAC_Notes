Internal linkage:- it means storage is created to represent the identifier only for the file being compiled. Other files may use the same identifier name with internal linkage, or for a global variable, and no conflicts will be found by the linker - separate storage is created for each identifier. Internal linkage is specified by the keyword "static" in C and C++.

in simple words, static global variables cannot be accessed outside the file. This is known as "Internal Linkage".


close the existing solution


create 	new project
			Empty project
	next

project name :-  Internal_1
location :-  <your regular folder> C:\MyCpp

select: - place solution and project in the same directory


		
		First.cpp

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
void disp()
{
	extern int num;
	cout<<"in disp\t"<<num<<endl;
	void fun(); // no need to use "extern" keyword as it is by default extern
	cout<<"from disp calling fun\t";
	fun();
}


compile above file. ( ctrl + f7 )  [ only compile , don't build ]


close the solution

create 	new project
			Empty project

				next

project name :-  Internal_2
location :-  <your regular folder> C:\MyCpp

select: - place solution and project in the same directory

		
		Second.cpp


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
#include "C:\MyCpp\Internal_1\First.cpp"

static int num = 100;
static void fun()
{
	cout << "in fun" << endl;
}
int main()
{
	cout << "in main\t" << num << endl;
	disp();
	cout << "from main calling fun\t";
	fun();
}

compile "Second.cpp", ( ctrl + f7 )

	build it ( ctrl+shift+B ) . 
	it will give "linker error", i.e. "unresolved symbols num and fun".

since num and fun are static they can not be accessed from other translation unit.
