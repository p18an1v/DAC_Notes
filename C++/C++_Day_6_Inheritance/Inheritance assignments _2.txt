1) 
class course
{
	//here
};
class DacCourse:public course
{
	// here
};

you should be able to say following

course *c=new course;
c->fees(); // course version should be called
c=new DacCourse;
c->fees();  // DacCourse version should be called


2) 
Create a base class FourWheeler. Declare pure virtual function “void start()” in it. 			
Define following sub classes for this class. 
A) Qualis b) Sumo c) Volvo 					
Define “start” function in these classes.			In main function , create array of pointer to FourWheeler which will contain objects of these three sub classes. 
Now traverse the array and call all the child class methods.

3)
Create a base class “Subject”.Declare pure virtual function “void maxmarks()” in it.  Define following sub classes for this class. A) Maths b) History c) English.	Define “maxmarks” in these classes.

now write a global function "show" which will accept "subject class pointer" as an argument. this function should be able to call "maxmarks()" of any child class which is passed.
From main function try to call this function by passing various child classes.


4) same as above except it has to be done using reference of parent class.

5) create an abstract class Shape with
	virtual void display()
	{
		cout<<"display on the canvas"<<endl;
	}
	and
	pure virtual function (contract) void draw() 
functions.

now derive 3 classes from Shape
	Circle,Triangle and Rectangle
in the main function create array of pointer to Shape class and store all the child class objects addresses inside it. Traverse the array and invoke "display()" and "draw()" functions.
