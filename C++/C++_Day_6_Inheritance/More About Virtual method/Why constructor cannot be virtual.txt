A constructor cannot be virtual because the purpose of a constructor is to initialize an object of a particular class, and the concept of polymorphism (which virtual functions enable) doesn't apply until after the object is fully constructed.

Polymorphism requires that the object is fully constructed and the virtual function table (vtable) is set up. In the constructor object is in the process of construction , not yet fully constructed.
