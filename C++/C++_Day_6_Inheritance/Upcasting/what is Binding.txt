what is Binding?

resolving function call with the function body is called as Binding.

how many types of Binding are there?

2 types: Early binding and Late binding

	Early binding means resolving function call with function body at the compilation time.
	
	Late binding means resolving function call with function body at the runtime.
	
C++ by default supports "Early Binding". In order to achieve "Late Binding" , we need to use "virtual function" or "pure virtual function".
