abstract class

abstract class is a class which has at least one pure virtual function.


pure virtual function is the one which is declared (using virtual keyword) and not defined.
	e.g
	class A   // abstract class
	{
		public:
			virtual void disp()=0; // pure virtual function[contract]
	};

abstract class can not be instantiated but pointer or reference to abstract class can be created.

Along with pure virtual function, abstract class may contain virtual as well as non-virtual functions.

child class of an abstract class has to define pure virtual function declared in parent class.

can abstract class have a constructor [ it's because we cannot instantiate the abstract class ]
	ans: yes, that constructor can be invoked when we instantiate the child class.
