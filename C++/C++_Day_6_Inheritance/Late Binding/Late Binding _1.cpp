/* In the following code, since the parent class method is virtual, while invoking method through a pointer, content of the pointer is considered. This happens during runtime. Hence it is called as "Late binding" or "Dynamic Polymorphism" or "Runtime Polymorphism".

Note:- In C++ Late binding or Runtime Polymorphism can be achieved using

	a) virtual functions
	b) parent class pointer or reference
