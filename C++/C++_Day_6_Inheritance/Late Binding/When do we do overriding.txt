class Animal
{
	public:
	virtual void makeSound()
	{
	}
}
class Tiger:public Animal
{
	public:
	void makeSound()    // overriding makeSound() of Animal
	{
		cout<<"roar"<<endl;
	}
}
class Dog:public Animal
{
	public:
	void makeSound()  // overriding makeSound() of Animal
	{
		cout<<"bark"<<endl;
	}
}
class Cat:public Animal
{
	public:
	void makeSound()   // overriding makeSound() of Animal
	{
		cout<<"meaw"<<endl;
	}
}



so in the above case when we write "makeSound()" in all the child classes , what exactly are we doing ?

we are overriding "makeSound()" method in all these child classes.

When do we do overriding?

	when behaviour is same ( makeSound ) but implementations are different ( roar/bark/meao)
