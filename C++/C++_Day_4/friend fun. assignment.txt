1) class First
   {
      char str1[20];
   };
   class Second
   {
      char str2[20];
   };
write a friend function,which will create a  new string containing str1,str2 and also display it.

2) 
class First
{
	int a;
};
class Second
{
	public:
		void fun1(){}
		void fun2(){}
		void fun3(){}
};

Above code is incomplete.
Make sure that all the member functions of "Second" will access "a".
