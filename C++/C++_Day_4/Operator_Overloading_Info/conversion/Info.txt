conversion


L=R
destination=source

R to L  conversion always

if  L and R both are equal e.g. int=int
	or
L is larger than R e.g.    double=float

In these cases we have implicit conversion.


But if we have
L is smaller than R
	we have to go for explicit conversion with the help of typecasting.


conversion in case of User defined data types like class or structure.


There are 3 types of conversions:
1) primitive to User Defined
2) User defined to primitive
3) User defined to User defined

Primitive to UD can be done using
	a) parameterized constructor inside destination
	b) operator= overload inside destination

UD to primitive can be done using
	conversion operator function inside source.

UD to UD can be done using
	a) operator= inside destination
	b) conversion operator function inside source
