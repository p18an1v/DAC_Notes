a) when pointer is a member of class
b) u have allocated memory dynamically for that pointer
c) u have applied "delete" on that pointer inside the destructor


what is the need to define operator=  explicitly when it is provided by default  by compiler?

a) when pointer is a member of class
b) u have allocated memory dynamically for that pointer

what is the need to define destructor explicitly when it is provided by default by compiler?

	in order to solve the problem of "memory leak" we have to define destructor and apply "delete" on that pointer.
