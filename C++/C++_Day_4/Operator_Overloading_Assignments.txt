1) class Number
   {
       int num;
   }
In the main function,
Number n1(8),n2(4),n3(20),n4(6),n5;
n5=n1-n2
n5=n3/n4;
n5=n1*n3




2) class sample
   {
	private:
		char ch;
	public:
		sample(char ch)
		{
			this->ch=ch;
		}
  };

given above class.

write a global function "display" which will access "ch" directly and display it.
call this function from main function.



3) Given

class Module1
{
	int duration;
	public:
		Module1(int k)
		{
			duration=k;
		}
};

class Module2
{
	int duration;
	public:
		Module2(int k)
		{
			duration=k;
		}
};		
	
write a global function "check" which will take 2 modules (i.e. Module1 and Module2 ) and check whether Modules are same or not.
call this "check" function from main function.	





4) Define a class , write two member functions 
	void disp1(){ //some code }
	void disp2(){ // some code }

	Try to call disp1   from    disp2.

5) Define a class with constructor and  member function

	create object, call member function
	now create a reference to that object, and using that reference try to call member function
