			STL
		Standard Template Library

it consists of inbuilt class templates for various differnt data structures like vector,list,map etc. It also consists of iterators ( for traversing through the data structures) and algorithms ( specific tasks like count, max,min etc).

what's the main difference between STL classes and normal array?

normal array is static in nature , size is fixed.

STL classes are dynamic in nature, meaning we can always increase the size of internal array.
