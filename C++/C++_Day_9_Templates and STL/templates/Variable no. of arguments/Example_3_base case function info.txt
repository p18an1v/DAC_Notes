is it necessary that base case function (in our example "disp") should be parameter less?



Yes, it should be paramterless. If you gave it parameters, e.g.

void disp(int n);


then the compiler would never match it when the argument pack becomes empty — because the recursive call disp() has no arguments left.

So yes — the base case function must match the final recursive call, and for this pattern, that’s a parameterless function.


what about a return type?
	it can be anything but it is highly recommended that it should be "void".
[ there is no point , base function returns some value ]
