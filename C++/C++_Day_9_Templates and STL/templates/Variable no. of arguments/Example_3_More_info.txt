First Call

disp(i, d, str, c);

Arguments: i = 1, d = 3.4, str = "hello", c = 'A'

T: int (the type of the first argument, i)

Args...: double, const char[6], char (the remaining arguments after i)

Inside the function:

first = 1 (value of i)
args... = (d, str, c) — These are passed on recursively.

Now the function prints 1, and recursively calls:

disp(d, str, c);

Second Call

disp(d, str, c);

Arguments: d = 3.4, str = "hello", c = 'A'
 
T: double (the type of the first argument, d)
Args...: const char[6], char (the remaining arguments after d)

Inside the function:
first = 3.4 (value of d)
args... = (str, c) — These are passed on recursively.

Now the function prints 3.4, and recursively calls:

disp(str, c);

Third Call

disp(str, c);

Arguments: str = "hello", c = 'A'

T: const char[6] (the type of the first argument, str)
Args...: char (the remaining argument after str)

Inside the function:
first = "hello" (value of str)
args... = (c) — This is passed on recursively.

Now the function prints "hello", and recursively calls:

disp(c);

Fourth Call

disp(c);

Arguments: c = 'A'

T: char (the type of the first argument, c)
Args...: Empty (no remaining arguments)

Inside the function:
first = 'A' (value of c)

args... = () — No arguments left, so the function will now call the base case i.e."disp()".

Now the function prints A, and recursively calls:

disp(); // Base case: no arguments
Base Case Call

disp(); // No arguments left

This is the base case of the recursion. Since there are no arguments left, it simply prints "terminating now" and ends the recursion.

so,
Args... is a parameter pack that holds the remaining arguments in each recursive call.

In each recursive call, Args... contains the types of the remaining arguments, and the first argument (first) is handled separately.
As the recursion proceeds, Args... progressively shrinks, until it becomes empty, at which point the base case (empty "disp") is triggered.
