static member

static members are allocated memory as soon as class gets loaded in the memory. They are not associated with the instance.
Since they are not associated with instance, they are having only one copy in the memory, irrespective of no.of instances created.
They can be accessed by class name. They are also called as "class variables".

static member function is used to access private static member.

e.g.

Account object
	non-static members - accid, name, balance etc.
	static member - roi


we can't use "this" pointer with static member because static member is not associated with object and "this" is the pointer points to the current object. Hence they both are contradictory.
