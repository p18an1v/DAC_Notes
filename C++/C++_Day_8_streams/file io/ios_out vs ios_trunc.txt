Difference Between ios::out and ios::trunc:

ios::out (Output Mode):
Opens the file for writing. If the file doesn’t exist, it’s created. If it exists, contents may be truncated depending on the implementation—most compilers do truncate by default.

ios::trunc (Truncate Mode):
Ensures that the file is always cleared (truncated) when opened, even if it exists.


ios::trunc tells the file stream to erase (truncate) the file contents when opening it — but it only makes sense in combination with a writing mode like ios::out.


Use ios::out | ios::trunc when you want to overwrite the file content every time it's opened.
