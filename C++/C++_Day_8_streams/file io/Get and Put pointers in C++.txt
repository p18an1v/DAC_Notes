In C++, when working with file streams (such as ifstream or ofstream), you deal with two main types of file pointers or stream pointers:

Get pointer (g in seekg and tellg): This pointer indicates the position in the file where the next input operation (e.g., get(), >>, or getline()) will occur. It is used when reading data from the file.

Put pointer (p in seekp and tellp): This pointer indicates the position in the file where the next output operation (e.g., put(), <<, or write()) will occur. It is used when writing data to the file.

The functions seekg(), seekp(), tellg(), and tellp() allow you to manipulate and query these pointers.

seekg() and tellg() can be used together to move and then check the position of the get pointer, and similarly for seekp() and tellp() with the put pointer.


fstream_obj.seekg(offset, direction);

offset: The number of bytes to move the pointer.

direction: This specifies the reference point from which the offset is applied. It can be one of the following:

ios::beg: The offset is applied from the beginning of the file.
ios::cur: The offset is applied from the current position of the pointer.
ios::end: The offset is applied from the end of the file 


fstream_obj.seekp(offset, direction);

offset: The number of bytes to move the pointer.
direction: The reference point from which the offset is applied, which can be:

ios::beg: The offset is applied from the beginning of the file.
ios::cur: The offset is applied from the current position of the pointer.
ios::end: The offset is applied from the end of the file.
