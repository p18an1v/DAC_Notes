modes can be
ios::in  - for reading
ios::out - for writing
ios::app - for appending.can be used with files capable of output

ios::ate - causes seek to the end of the file,when file is opened.Still i/o operations can occur anywhere within the file


ios::ate mode allows us to add data or change data anywhere in the file But In ios::app mode allows us to add data only to the end of file.
The difference between the two is that with "ate" if you change the file position you can write to the middle or beginning of the file.  With "app" even if you change the file position you will write to the end of the file.  If you aren't planning on changing the file position at all, just use "app".


ios::trunc  - destroy existing file and create new if it does not exist.

ios::binary - open in binary mode.by def.it is text mode.

Default modes
ifstream   - ios::in
ofstream   - ios::out | ios::trunc
fstream    - ios::in | ios::out
