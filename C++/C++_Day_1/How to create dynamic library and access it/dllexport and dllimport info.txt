You are defining a class implementation or function definition within a dll. You want another program to use the class or function. Here you use "dllexport" as you are creating a class or a function that you (developer) wish the dll to expose.

	e.g.

__declspec(dllexport)void disp2()
{
    cout << "inside disp2 of dll file" << endl;
}



You are using a function provided by a dll. You include a header supplied with the dll. Here the header uses "dllimport" to bring in the implementation to be used by the current program (client program)
	e.g.

inside header file created by developer ,which will be included by client later.

	__declspec(dllimport)void disp2();
