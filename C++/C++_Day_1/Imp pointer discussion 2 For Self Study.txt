// following example is valid as per C++17

int arr[4] = { 10,20,30,40 };
int* ptr = arr;
cout << (++*ptr)++<< "\t" << *ptr << endl;
cout << arr[0] << endl;

	output:			11		12
				12

here, (++*ptr)
	*ptr gets the value of arr[0] i.e. 10 and increments it to 11 
		11 gets printed
	then because of post increment 11 gets incremented to 12

	*ptr
		prints 12
	arr[0] 
		obviously prints 12



15)
// what if we want to print value "20" using "ptr"

int arr[4] = { 10,20,30,40 };
int* ptr = arr;
cout << *++ptr<<endl;


16)

// what if we want to print value "30" using "ptr"

int arr[4] = { 10,20,30,40 };
int* ptr = arr;
cout << *++++ptr<<endl;


17)

int arr[] = { 4, 10, 15, 20 };
int* ptr = arr;
cout << *++ptr + *ptr << "\t" << *ptr << endl;

	output:  20          10

*++ptr
	here first ptr is incremented to point to the value 10 
	because of +  , it adds 10 +10
		i.e. 20    and *ptr prints 10


18) 

int arr[] = { 4, 10, 15, 20 };
int* ptr = arr;
cout << *ptr++ + *ptr << "\t" << *ptr << endl;


	output:  8        10

*ptr++ + *ptr 
	what it does is :
	*ptr takes the value of 4 and because of + sign , first it adds i.e. 4+4 i.e 8 and then it increments the ptr ( post increment ) so now ptr points to value 10 and it prints the value.


19)

int arr[] = { 4, 10, 15, 20 };
int* ptr = arr;
cout << *++ptr + *ptr++ << "\t" << *ptr << endl;

	output:  20            15

*++ptr
	first ptr increments to point to arr[1] i.e. 10 
	*++ptr + *ptr++
		"prints 20" and increments ptr further to arr[2] i.e. 15
	*ptr in the last part of cout will "print 15"


20)

int arr[] = { 5, 10, 15, 20 };
int* ptr = arr;
cout << ++*ptr + *ptr << endl;

	output:  12

	++*ptr will retrieve  arr[0] value i.e. 5 and increment it
	i.e. arr[0] value now becomes 6
	+  *ptr  will consider 6 as a latest value of arr[0]

		so answer is 12


21) 

int arr[] = { 5, 10, 15, 20 };
int* ptr = arr;
cout << *ptr++ + ++*ptr << "\t"<<*ptr<<endl;

	output: 12          10

++*ptr evaluates first
	which makes arr[0]  as 6
now
	*ptr++ 
		will take 6 as arr[0] value

	because of  +   
		6+6  it "prints 12"

	above we have post increment of the pointer ptr as well
	because of that ptr increments to  point to  arr[1]
		so it "prints 10"


	
22) 

	int arr[] = { 5, 10, 15, 20 };
	int* ptr = arr;
	cout << ++*ptr++ + *ptr <<"\t"<<*ptr<< endl;

	output:  12          12      10

	++*ptr++
		*ptr gives u  5
			because of ++ on the left side 5 becomes 6

	+  *ptr
		it takes  6+6  
			prints 12
	++ on the right side takes pointer to value 10

23)

	int arr[] = { 5, 10, 15, 20 };
	int* ptr = arr;
	cout << *ptr + *++ptr << endl;

	output:  20
	
	Right side first: *++ptr → increment to 10 → gives 10

	Left side: now ptr also points to 10, so *ptr = 10
		 10 + 10 = 20

24)

int x = 5;
int* p = &x;
cout << ++(*p) + (*p)++ <<"\t"<<*p<< endl;

	output:   12       7

++(*p)

	*p gives  5  which is incremented to 6 due to ++
(*p)++
	takes *p which is now 6

	6+6   prints 12 and then it will increment 6 to 7


25)

int arr[] = { 5, 10 };
int* p = arr;
cout << ++(*p++) + *p <<"\t"<<*p<< endl;

	output:  12       10

++(*p++)

	here *p gives 5  
	because of ++ on the left side
	5 becomes 6
	that 6 is considered for addition
	so,  6+6   prints 12
	then ++ of p on the right side will increment the pointer to point to 10
	that's why last *p  prints 10


26)

int arr[] = { 12, 20, 30 };
int* p = arr;
cout << (*p++) + (*p++) << "\t" << *p << endl;

	output:  24         30

(*ptr++) + (*ptr++)

	will take *ptr as 12 and add them prints   24
now ptr++
	will make ptr points to 20
one more ptr++ 
	will make ptr points to 30

27)

int arr[] = { 10, 20, 30, 40 };
int* p = arr;
cout << *p++ + ++*p << "\t" << *p << endl;


	output:   22         20

*p++ + ++*p
	here  ++*p
		will make 10 to 11
	*p++
		will take incremented value as 11
	11 + 11 will print  22
	then p++ will take place which will increment p to point to 20
	so, *p  will print  20


28)

int arr[] = { 1,2,3,4 };
int* p = arr;
cout << *p + *++p + *++p << "\t" << *p << endl;

	output:  9          3

*++p
	will make p increment to point to 2
one more *++p
	will make p increment to point to 3

now for addition *p is taken as 3
 	so, 3+3+3   will print 9
and *p at the end will print  3

29)

int arr[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
int* p = arr;
cout << ++*(p + 2) << "\t" << arr[2] << endl;

	output:  4             4

++*(p+2)

p+2 will increment p to point to 3
now *p will give value 3  which will be incremented to 4
so it will print 4

arr[2] is the location where p is pointing to and this location's value has been changed from 3 to 4
so, arr[2]  also prints   4


30)

int x = 2, y = 3;
int *p = &x, *q = &y;
cout << ++*p + ++*q << "\t" << x << "\t" << y << endl;

	output:   7         3         4

++*p
	will increment 2 to 3 so, value of x is 3
++*q
	will increment 3 to 4  so, value of y is 4

so, 3+4   will print 7

value of x is now  3

value of y is now  4


31)

int arr[] = { 10, 20, 30, 40 };
int* p = arr;
cout << *p++ + *++p << "\t" << *p << endl;

	output:  40           30

*++p 
	will evaluate first
it will increment p to point to 20

for addition latest value of *p which is 20 in taken
	so, 20+20  will print 40
++ on the right side of p will now evaluate
	which will increment p to point to 30
so, *p at the end will print 30

32)

int calc(int *p) 
{
	return ++*p * ++*p;
}
int main() 
{
	int a = 5;
	cout << calc(&a) << "\t" << a << endl;
}

	output:   49             7


value of a is 5
address of a is passed to  p

inside calc function
	++*p  *  ++*p
will increment 5 to 6
and then 6  to  7

so for multiplication latest value of *p  i.e.  a is taken which is  7
7*7   will print  49

value of a is now 7


33)

int calc(int* p) 
{
	return ++*p * *p++;
}
int main() 
{
	int a = 5;
	cout << calc(&a) << "\t" << a << endl;
}

	output: 36          6

value of a is 5

p holds the address of a

++*p
	will increment  5  to 6

so for multiplication  6 is considered
	6*6   will print 36
p++
	will now increment the pointer but there is no value at the next address

in the main function when we print "a", it is now  6


34)

int calc(int* p) 
{
	return ++*p * (*p)++;
}
int main() 
{
	int a = 5;
	cout << calc(&a) << "\t" << a << endl;
}

	output: 36           7


value of a is 5

it's address goes to p

++*p
	will increment 5  to  6

for the multiplication  6*6 is considered so it prints  36

now (*p)++
	this ++ will increment 6 to 7
so in the main function when we print the value of "a" , the latest value of "a" is 7.
