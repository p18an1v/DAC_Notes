1)

char name[20] = "Rajesh";
char* ptr = name;
cout << *ptr++ << "\t" << *ptr << endl;
	
	output: R            a

	first *ptr is evaluated which prints "R" and then ptr is incremented, so it displays "a".



2)

int arr[4] = { 10,20,30,40 };
int* ptr = arr;
cout << (*ptr)++ <<"\t"<<*ptr<< endl;


	output:  10          11

	first *ptr is evaluated which prints 10 and then *ptr i.e. the value (10) where ptr is point to is incremented. That's why we get output "11"



3)

int arr[4] = { 10,20,30,40 };
int* ptr = arr;
cout << ++(*ptr) <<"\t"<<*ptr<<endl;
	
output:  11			11


	first *ptr is evaluated which is 10 and 10 is incremented to 11 which gets printed.


4) 

int arr[4] = {10,20,30,40};
int* ptr = arr;
cout << ++++*ptr <<"\t"<<*ptr<<endl;


output:  12			12

	first *ptr is evaluated which is 10 and 10 is incremented to 11, 11 is incremented to 12  which finally gets printed.


5)

int arr[4] = {10,20,30,40};
int* ptr = arr;
cout << ++*ptr++<<"\t"<<*ptr<<endl;

	output: 11            20

	first *ptr is evaluated which is 10 and 10 is incremented to 11 which gets printed and then ptr is incremented to the next position.


6)
int arr[4] = { 10,20,30,40 };
int* ptr = arr;
cout <<  (*ptr++)++ << "\t" << *ptr <<"\t"<<arr[0]<< endl;

	output: 10      20    11

	first *ptr is evaluated which prints  10
	then because of "++ inside the bracket", ptr moves to arr[1]
	even though ptr has moved to arr[1] , ++ outside the bracket is applied to arr[0] value (i.e. what *ptr gives u) . 

7)

int arr[4] = { 10,20,30,40 };
int* ptr = arr;
cout << *(ptr++)<<"\t"<<*ptr<<endl;

	output: 10            20

	first *ptr is evaluated which prints 10 and then ptr is incremented because of which 20 is printed.
	[ Imp note:  *ptr++ and *(ptr++) are equivalent. Both mean:

Dereference the current value of ptr, then increment ptr.  ]


8)

int arr[4] = { 10,20,30,40 };
int* ptr = arr;
cout << *(++ptr)<<"\t"<<*ptr<<endl;

	output: 20                  20

	first ptr is incremented to the next position and then *ptr is evaluated , that's the reason it prints 20           20 .

	

9) 

int arr[4] = { 10,20,30,40 };
int* ptr = arr;
cout << ++*(ptr++)<<"\t"<<*ptr<<endl;  // same like      ++*ptr++


	output: 11			20


	first *ptr is evaluated which is 10 and 10 is incremented to 11 (because of ++ on the left side ) which gets printed and then ptr is incremented (because of ++ on the right side) to the next position ,that's why   20  is displayed.


10) 

int arr[4] = { 10,20,30,40 };
int* ptr = arr;
cout << ++*(++ptr)<<"\t"<<*ptr<<endl;


	output: 21			21

	first ptr gets incremented to the next position ( because of ++ inside the bracket ) , then *ptr is evaluated which is 20 and then 20 is incremented (because of ++ outside the bracket ) to 21 which gets printed.


11)

int arr[4] = { 10,20,30,40 };
int* ptr = arr;
cout << ++++*(++ptr) << "\t" << *ptr << endl;


	output: 22			22

	first ptr gets incremented to the next position , then *ptr is evaluated which is 20 and then 20 is incremented to 21 , 21 is incremented to 22 which finally gets printed.


12)

int arr[4] = { 10,20,30,40 };
int* ptr = arr;
cout << ++++*(ptr++)<<"\t"<<*ptr<<endl;


	ouput: 12			20

	first *ptr gets evaluated which is 10 [ *(ptr++) is same as *ptr++ ] , then 10 is incremented to 11, 11 is incremented to 12 ( because of two ++ on left side ) which gets printed and at the end ptr is incremented to the next position [ due to ++ right side ] because of which 20 is displayed.

int missile(int *ip) 
{ 
	return ++++(*ip)* (*ip); 
}
int main() 
{
	int i = 4;
	cout << i << ":" << missile(&i) << ":" << *(&i)<<endl;
}

i=4

in the cout , value of i is printed  i.e. 4

missile function is called by passing the address of "i" which is collected inside the pointer "*ip"

ip - points to the address of i 

*ip means i   i.e.   4

with double ++ (increment operators)
	i is incremented to 5 and then 6 

that means now the value of "i" is 6

now *ip  *  *ip will be evaluated
	i.e. 6*6

so the output of
	cout<<missile(&i)
		is 36
and the output of
	cout<<*(&i)
		is 6

so the total output is
	4:36:6
