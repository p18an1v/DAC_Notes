/*
int&& r = 10;

r is an rvalue reference (denoted by &&), and it is 
bound to a temporary object, the literal 10.
In C++, an rvalue reference can bind to an rvalue 
(temporary object like 10 of int type).
This binding does not create a new variable 10, 
but it creates a reference (r) that refers to the 
temporary object 10.
cout << r << endl;

This prints the value of the temporary object that r 
is referencing, which is 10.
r = 20;:

The value of the object that r refers to is modified. 
Here, r refers to the temporary object 10, and now this 
temporary object is updated to 20.
The key point here is that r is a reference to the 
temporary object 10, so when you modify r, you modify 
the value of the temporary object.
In C++, temporaries can be modified through rvalue 
references (which is not possible with regular lvalue 
references).
cout << r << endl;:

After modifying r, the value of the temporary object 
has changed to 20, so this prints 20.
