In modern c++ when you don't define any constructor in the class, compiler provides 3 constructors  default constructor, copy constructor and move constructor.

if you explicitly define a copy constructor and not the move constructor, compiler will not provide you move constructor.

if you explicitly define a move constructor, and not the copy constructor explicitly,the compiler does not generate a copy constructor implicitly.


if you provide move assignment explicitly and not the assignment operator then compiler will not provide assignment operator implicitly


The compiler implicitly declares and defines:

	Default Constructor

Initializes members with default values (if possible).

	Copy Constructor

Performs a member-wise copy of each member.

	Copy Assignment Operator  ( operator=)

	Move Constructor (C++11 and onward)

Performs a move operation on members (if they support move semantics).

	Move Assignment Operator (C++11 and onward)

	Destructor
