Advantages of Smart pointers

1) Resource management
2) Avoiding memory leaks
3) Avoiding dangling pointers
4) pointer ownership
	means if one pointer points to a resource, the other pointer should not point to that same resource.
5) simplify memory management
	w/o smart pointers you've to be very careful about calling "delete" at the right moment. with smart pointers you don't have to bother about it now.

6) Avoiding manual memory management errors
