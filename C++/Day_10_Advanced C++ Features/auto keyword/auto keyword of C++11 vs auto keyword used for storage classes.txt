The auto keyword in C++11 is used for type deduction, allowing the compiler to automatically determine the type of a variable based on its initializer. On the other hand, the auto keyword used for storage class (storage duration) specifies automatic storage duration for variables in C and C++. Let's delve into each:

auto for type deduction (C++11 and later):
Used for automatic type deduction during variable declaration.
Enables writing more concise and readable code by allowing the compiler to infer the type.
Introduced in C++11 to facilitate the use of complex types without explicitly specifying them.

auto x = 10;     // Type of x is deduced to be int
auto y = 3.14;   // Type of y is deduced to be double

auto for storage class (C and C++):

Specifies automatic storage duration for variables.
Variables declared with auto storage class have a lifetime limited to the block in which they are defined. They are automatically destroyed when the block is exited.
This usage of auto is considered illegal (for representing automatic storage class) in modern C++. Instead, it's generally advised to use block-scope variables without specifying any storage class.

auto int x;  // illeagal in C++ 11 onwards

In modern C++, when you see the keyword auto, it's always for type deduction only.
