The call to join blocks the calling thread (in this case, the main thread) until the joined thread finishes execution. 


Why Does Runtime Error Occur If We Don’t Call join() or detach()?


In C++, when you create a std::thread, it must be either:

Joined (using join()), or

Detached (using detach()),

	[ When you call t1.detach(); on a std::thread, you're telling the system:

"Let this thread run on its own. I no longer care about it. I won’t wait for it or manage it."

	]

before the thread object (t1) is destroyed.

If you don't do either, the C++ runtime terminates the program with a runtime error (often std::terminate is called), even if the thread finishes successfully.
