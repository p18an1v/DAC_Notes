if overridden method has got return type "Parent" , overriding method can have return type as "Child". This is allowed as a "Co-variant return type".

What if overridden method has got return type "Child", is overriding method allowed to have "Parent" as a return type?

	No

Why?


	ans:- 


class A
{
};
class B:public A
{
}

class base
{
	public:
	virtual B* disp()
	{
		cout<<"base disp"<<endl;
		return new B();
	}
}
class sub:public base
{
	public:
	A*  disp()
	{
		cout<<"sub disp"<<endl;
		return new A();
	}
}



above code will not compile, but for the time being let's assume that it will compile successfully. What can be the side effect of this code?

	some where in the code if we say

	int main()
	{
		base *ptr=new sub();
		B *ref1=ptr->disp();
	}



here for the compiler "ptr" is of type "base", so compiler will search "disp" in base 
is it there ?    yes
is it accessible ?   yes
is it virtual ?  yes

your statement inside "main"

	B *ref1=ptr->disp();

is correct as per compiler because "disp" of base has "B*" as a return type.

so as per compiler's instruction (which you know) dynamic binding will take place i.e. "sub" class "disp" which will return "A*" which "B *ref1" cannot catch. It should not happen that's why compiler stops you at:



class base
{
	public:
	virtual B* disp()
	{
		cout<<"base disp"<<endl;
		return new B();
	}
}
class sub:public base
{
	public:
	A*  disp()      // compilation error
	{
		cout<<"sub disp"<<endl;
		return new A();
	}
}
