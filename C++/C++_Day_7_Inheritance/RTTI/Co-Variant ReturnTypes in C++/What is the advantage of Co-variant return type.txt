class Sub:public Base

	public:
		Car* disp()

Ans:-
		FourWheeler* disp()
		{
			return new Car();
		}

this is perfectly right. But when client sees the documentation ( only prototype) of this method , he can just see "FourWheeler* disp()" and not the code of the method. So he can just guess what will be returned whether "FourWheeler" or any of its sub classes like "Car","Bus" or "Truck".


		Car* disp()
		{
			return new Car();
		}

this gives client correct idea ( even by seeing just a prototype "Car* disp()") what exactly he is going to get i.e. Car.  So this is the actual advantage of "Co-variant Return type".
