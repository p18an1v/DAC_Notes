RTTI
Runtime type identification
reqd. in polymorphic languages like C++,java, C# etc.

not reqd.in non-polymorphic language like c,because the type of each object is known at compile time.

e.g
Shape class pointer can point to any child class instance, i.e. Triangle,Rectangle,Circle or Polygon.
At a given time if u want to check the existence of a particular child in parent class pointer,rtti is used.

rtti can be achieved through "typeid operator" or "dynamic_cast".

To obtain an object's type use "typeid "
include header file <typeinfo>

typeid(object)
object is the object whose type you will be obtaining.It may be any type, i.e. userdefined or built in.

typeid() returns a ref.of type "type_info" class.

type_info Class

The type_info class describes type information generated within the program by the compiler. Objects of this class effectively store a pointer to a name for the type.


type_info class has following methods

bool operator==(const type_info&)
bool operator!=(const type_info&)
const char* name()



dynamic_cast

dynamic_cast<targettype>(expr)
type and the expression being cast must evaluate to a pointer or reference.
dynamic_cast is used to cast one type of pointer into other or one type of reference into other.It is used to perform casts on polymorphic types.
