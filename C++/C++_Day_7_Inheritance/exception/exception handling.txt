exception
exception is an event which interrupts the normal programming flow.i.e when a particular exception gets raised in the program,program aborts.

here if you don't want your program to get aborted you need to handle the exception.

i.e if exception is handled properly,the program will not abort.

there are three terms used in exception
try,catch and throw

try- program statements that you want to monitor for exceptions are contained in a try block.

catch- the exception is caught using catch and processed.
catch block will execute only when the exception is raised.

throw- to raise the exception


syntax for handling exception:

try
{
// possible statements
}
catch(type)
{
//statements to be processed in case of exception
}

here type can be any type i.e. built in types or user defined types.
