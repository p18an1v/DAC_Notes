cat cmd :
cat > myfile.txt : this whatever you type will save in the file
ctrl+d : bahar ajayega (to stop writing)

it will create file if not exits 
and override the old file

.dat extension is there old extension


cat >> myfile.dat // .sh
ye bina override kare data file mai dalta hai
(append data in the file)


cat name_details.txt
cat email_details.txt
cat phone_details.txt

combining all data in one file

cat name_details email_details.txt phone_details.txt > all_details.txt

it will create all_details file and put data from every file in new file

drawback of cat
head file.txt 
it will give 10 line of start
tail file.txt
last kay 10 line

head -n 5 file.txt
this will give 5 line only

Q.. oracle
if u wants to continuously monitor updates what you do


tail -f file.txt
for continuously monitor logs 
-f used for cntinously work 
you have to stop it 


more file.txt
less file.txt
press q to come out

less cmd is more efficient


nl text.txt 
number of line 

wc text.txt
count deta hat
number of lines , number of words , number of char


wc -w text.tx
words only

wc -l text.txt
lines onlu

wc -c text.txt 
char only


note : space ko bhi count karta hai


Piping :

head -n 5 filename.txt
nl filename.txt

phele ka data dusre ko connect karte ho tab jaa kay tumko data milta hai

head -n 5 text.txt | nl
head -n 5 text.txt  iss se jo output nikale ga wo nl ko doge 

creating a shell script 
nano combiner.sh

Q..
read n files given by user on prompt while running
combiner.sh amp1.txt amp2.txt amp3.txt
show all files given (name only)

if [ $# -eq 0 ]
then 
echo "error"
else 
for file in "$@"
do 
 echo "$file"
done
fi


$a jitney details uthaya hai string mai lakar detga

check if file exits

if [ -f "filename" ]
then 
  # exists
else
  #not



if [ $# -eq 0 ]
then 
echo "error"
else 
for file in "$@"
do 
  if [ -f "$file" ]
 then 
 echo "$file exisiting"
else 
 
 echo "$file not exits"
 fi
done
fi

check if file exists then print its data on screen else error


if [ $# -eq 0 ]
then 
echo "error"
else 
for file in "$@"
do 
  if [ -f "$file" ]
 then 
 echo "-------------------------"
  echo "$file"
  echo "------------------------"
  cat "$file"
else 
 
 echo "$file not exits"
 fi
done
fi


and combine all data in final.txt and at end show context of final.txt


outfile = "$filename.txt"
if [ $# -eq 0 ]
then 
 echo "no file is there"
else
  for file in "$@"
  do
  if [ -f "$file" ]
  echo "-------------------------"
  echo "$file"
  echo "------------------------"
  cat "$file"
  cat "$file" >> "$outfile"
  echo "--------------------------"
  echo "added content of $file to $outfile"
 else
   echp "$file not existing or can not be accessed"
 fi
done
fi


also print words lines and characters of combined file



what is grep
 searches content and return data found
 - print lines that match pattern
searches content of a fle

 grep "key" filename.txt

 grep -i "key" filename.txt
 -i removes the case sensitivity

 grep -i -n "key" filename.txt

 muje data cahiye sare files mai se tho use this kiskay andaar hai wo file la kar do
 grep -l "data" *.txt

 

Q..
-search and print from all files that has data using searching.sh

nano searching.sh
-search all files that has word given by user via positional argument
word = "data"
list_of_file = $(grep -l "$word" *.txt)
echo -e "data extracted:\n $list_of_file"

-use loop to print one file at a time
for file in "$list_of_file"
do
 echo "file:$file has $word"
done

-print all lines that has data
 grep -n -i "$word" "$file"


-using script


Q morning star company
nano count_shell_scripts.sh

list all *.sh files
count total lines generated

count = $(ls *.sh | wc  -l)
echo "$count"


count = $(ls "*$1"| wc  -l)
echo "$count"


mv cmd is rename cmd also

su - 
give root access

cut -d: -f /etc/passwd


interview perspective
grep
find
search


grep searches content of file
ls searches file at most on extenstion
find will search file/s dir on more than just extention
find can search on day/size/update/group/ mode

find . 
(.)dot current working directory

find . <option> <file type> <pattern>

find . -type f -name "*.txt"
find . -type f -iname "*.txt"

-atime -ctime -mtime days

a access
m modifi
c change

-amin -cmin -mmin

m -min

size can be c:bytes k:KB M:MB G:GB

Q..
shells.txt 
text.txt
dats.txt
separate separate file kay name in files mai chahinye

find . -type f -name "*.txt" > text.txt
find . -type f -name "*.sh" > shells.txt
find . -type f -name "*.dats" > dats.txt

 

wc -l < shells.txt
6 
its only give data

wc -l shells.txt
6 shells.txt


shells.txt se data lo and wc me dooo

create a single file which will group shells file 
*.sh files 1day , 2days , 3days... 10 days created
-atime -1 -2 -3 -4 -5... -10 (for loops) ((i=;i<;i--)

also add total number of files added on that day

echp "file is sorted manner" >> "$output"
echo "-----------------------------------">>"$output"


output="$output.txt"
for((i=0;i<=10;i++))
do
echo -e "files $i days\n" >> "$output"
echo "--------------------------------" >> "$output"
find . -type -name "*.sh" -atime -$i >> "$output"


count=$(find . -type f -name "*.sh" -mtime -$i | wc -l)
echo " Total cout  >> "$output.txt"

output = "shells.txt"
> "$shells.txt" 
//remove all datah
