what is oops ?...
way of nature thinking where use start form o/p needed understand process and then start with i/p

what is OS ?
a software which allow user of computer to control or connect with hardware of computer
generations ?

1g - machine lang
2g - assembly lang -> operation code
problem with first 2g is hardware dependent
lang change hardware band

3g - high level lang
what is compiler : translator to binary
4g - sql -> extract data from database->crud
5g - NLP+AI

prompts -> (3+4+5)g




user -> gui -> api -> os -> kernel ->llc (low level calls)(system calls) ->  (device controller) ->to device driver -> device

High level calls - > api's
low level calls -> system calls

significane of power button - on/off both

os services
ui: cli + batch processing + gui + aui

cli:one by one cmd
batch processing : n cmd in a file , run file  shell script
gui : pointing device
aui : aural ui (oral user interface)


commmunocation
 message oriented ,broadcast comm
 inter ,intra pricess


Process management :
 new, runnable , running, blocked(waiting), terminating
 1 time -> new , terminate
 n times -> other;

Memory managemet
 handles all layers

cpu -> register -> cache -> primary memary(ram) -> secondary storage(ssd/hdd)
         kb          mb           gb                         tb


space decrease
speed increase
cost/bit increase


mcq exame
what is purging
process of shifting data from one layer to another -> either side
what is Archival
process of shifting data down in a hierarchy


what is cache memory
it is a buffer for faster access
we fill cash on the basis of locality of refrence , spatial or temporal
locality of references : Predicting what will be or can be used

5Q...
1.introduce your self -> 2/3 min
2.locality question -> eg: why you wana work with us
do proper home work about company

3.strength and weakness
4.where you see in next five year
5. ethic base questions ->


spatial (on address)
if somebody has acesss block 17 and 18 be ready with 19-20-21.

temporal (on time)
check what is being access again and again and keep it ready every time.

error handling :


error
state onwards which normal execution is not possible.(h/w,s/w, logical,i/p)
exception : reporting of errors , it rases the exception
exception handling : the pricess of either continuing with normal flow in prsenece of error or trying an alternate flow with error itselg


what if the use of exception handling
why need of exception handling in project
needed system does not crash
tesla example
hardware handling.



Kernal
user -> os -> kernel -> device controller + driver -> device
        brain  heart
slow process

kernel -> high level calls ko low level call main convert karega

shell scripting is fast directly connection to kernel

shell is mid level programming lang
rigid lang
strictly language


monolithic : one large code capable of doing everthing that you require
-ve : maintaining , managing , updating would always be troublesome. Restart on every change
+ve : fast

micro : code only provides an interface to use various devices and services Managing coding done entirely by the application and the coder
-ve : app development and managing became difficult/speed issues


hybrid : best of both
major sevices and access by kernel but can add new needed module


what is syntax
grammer of programing language

what is semantics 
when and why to use
when and what to



nano filename.sh
create or open file


imp
751
all read write  7
all read to execute 5
only execute to the write public 1 



#!/bin/bash
echo "hi testing this"




nano myfile.sh

#!/bin/bash
The system looks at the first line. Since it sees #!/bin/bash, it launches Bash to interpret and execute the script.
jaar nasel tar default shell use kar 
which could lead to errors if the script uses Bash-specific syntax.

other wise you have to specify which on bash you want to execute cmd
bash script.sh 

echo ""
echo "worked"


ctrl + o
ctrl + x

chmod 777 ./filename.sh
./filename.sh

cat cmd show file details on screen

read name
echo "hi $name how are you"

read -p "where are you from " native

read -p "who are you where are you from " name native

echo -e "so your name $name \n and your from $native"
to active \n give -e

crossover :- 




positional parameter


        0        1    2   3
./ filename.sh arg1 arg2 arg3
name of the file $0
$# total count
$* arguments are
$1,$2 for specific 


Arithmatic operators
$(($a+$b)) best option
$((a+b)) may work maynot there are deffrent version


relational oprator for number
int1 -eq int2  =
int1 -ne int2  !=
int1 -gt int2   >
int1 -ge       >=
int1 -lt       <
int1 -le       =<


Q..
double the number without using arithmetic oprator
<< increase by *2

>> divide by /2

Q.
give me 1's or 2's compluments if ~128

rev sign  and -1

-128-1
ans = -129

for ~(-226)

ans = 225


conditional statements

if [test] expression
then
 echo
else

read -p "Enter your name and age " name age
if [ age -gt 18 ]             // if(( age>=18 )) only in modern base activate internally
then 
   echo "$name you can vote"
else

interview question
check that user has given positional argument or not if not then give error 

if [ $# -ne 0 ]
then 
   if [ $1 -gt 18 ]
   then 
       echo "you can vote"
   else 
       echo "you cant vote"
   fi
else 
  echo "error : no argument is passed"
fi


add 2 number but if less or more than 2 given show error

if [ [ condition ] ]
then 
  statement
elif [ [ condition ] ]
